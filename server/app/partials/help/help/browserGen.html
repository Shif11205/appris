    <p>The genome browser stacks annotation tracks beneath genome coordinate positions, allowing
        rapid visual correlation of different types of information. we show APPRIS tracks from a
        screenshot of the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">UCSC Genome Browser</a>
        that is generated dynamically using description tracks in BED format. The browser window
        shows a section of the genome that corresponds to the genomic region of the gene.

    <p>It should be noted that the genome browser panel will only be shown for those species where Ensembl and UCSC are using the same build (otherwise the coordinates will be out of phase). The browser panel will not be shown in the APPRIS WebServer if the input is alternative sequences since APPRIS does not know the name of the gene.

    <h5>Note: The Genome Browser is not shown when the query is a protein sequence because,
        the browser needs genomic coordinates</h5>
