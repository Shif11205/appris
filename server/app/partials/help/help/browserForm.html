    <p>The annotations that appear in "APPRIS browsers" panels can be filtered by isoforms and the
        isoforms can be aligned in the sequence browser panel (using
        <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/" target="_blank">MUSCLE</a>).
        In addition, the server supports the downloading of annotations in some formats.
